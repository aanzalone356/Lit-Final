    <p id = 'p1'> "She knew the story of Orpheus, but it wasn't until the singing began that she realized it was the story of her life.(pg 124 SOW)"<br>
      Orfeo is referencing a version of the same story that was transformed into a play.<br>
      Something also notable is with the name change they also changed the ending to favor Orpheus.<br><br>
      Eurydice gets bitten and dies. Orpheus refused to let her go so he went to Hell to get her back from Hades.<br><br>
      Orpheus walked all the way to the entrance of Hell but, at the last moment he felt he could no longer trust Hades and decided to turn around.<br><br>
      He broke his deal with Hades and lost Euridice forever.</p>
