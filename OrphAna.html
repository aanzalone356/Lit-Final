    <p id = 'p1'>There are many slight variations to the telling of the story that change events.<br><br>
      There is one where Orpheus went to Hell and was unable to do anything for Euridice so he went to a Shamen and had her revived. This didnâ€™t work and
      he killed himself.<br><br>
      Another version replaces Eurydice with just a generic wife of another warrior.</p>
    <p id = 'p1'>A myth about the exploration of the physical unconscious similar to the myth of Demeter.<br><br>
      Hell tricked his mind to make the subconcious choice to turn around due to the immense doubt.</p>
